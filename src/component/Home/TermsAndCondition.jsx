            The XOX Rides Platform serves two primary functions: (1) as a marketplace where our Customers, referred to as "XOX Rides Customers," can make purchases, with possible delivery facilitated by XOX Rides, and (2) as a platform to offer transportation and delivery services to XOX Rides Customers and their authorized guests. These services are provided through our dedicated fleet of vehicles and our employee-drivers, known as "Drivers."
            <br /><br />
            To become an XOX Rides Customer, an individual must establish an XOX Rides Customer profile and explicitly agree to this Agreement in addition to our Privacy Policy.
            <br /><br />
            Each individual is limited to creating a single XOX Rides Customer profile, and XOX Rides retains the right to deactivate any additional profiles.
            As an XOX Rides Customer, you grant XOX Rides permission to match your trip request with an appropriate Driver, considering factors such as your location, pickup location, estimated time for a Driver to reach the pickup point, your destination, your user preferences, the efficiency of the XOX Rides Platform, and, if deemed necessary or advantageous, to cancel an existing match and reassign based on the same considerations.
            For the context of this Agreement, the encompassing services provided by XOX Rides to XOX Rides Customers and their guests via the XOX Rides Platform, which includes transportation services, along with any other services provided to XOX Rides Customers and their guests, are collectively referred to as the "Services." Any decision by an XOX Rides Customer to accept and utilize the Services is solely at the discretion of the respective XOX Rides Customer.
